          <h2>A must-have for anyone who loves scrambled eggs</h2>
          <p>
            Scrambled eggs is a dish made from eggs (usually chicken eggs)
            stirred, whipped, or beaten together typically with salt, butter,
            oil, and sometimes other ingredients, and heated so that they form
            into curds.

          <h2>Ingredients</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>2&dash;3 tbsp milk (optional)</li>
            <li>2 tbsp butter</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp salt (or to taste)</li>
            <li>1/8 tsp black pepper (or to taste)</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Directions</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Crack eggs into a measuring cup.</li>
            <li>Add the milk (if desired) and salt.</li>
            <li>Using a whisk or fork, beat the mixture until foamy.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a frying pan on medium heat</li>
            <li>Pour eggs into frying pan.</li>
            <li>
              Stir mixture to break up the egg as it cooks and allow more liquid
              to touch the hot pan. Stirring rapidly will create small curds,
              while slower stirring will create larger curds.
            </li>
            <li>
              Cook until just before you feel that they are done, since the eggs
              will continue to cook after being removed from the pan. The eggs
              are done when the sheen disappears; stop cooking just before this
              happens.
            </li>
            <li>
              Transfer to a plate. Season with black pepper (black pepper will
              burn and become bitter if seasoned before cooking).
            </li>
            <li>
              Eat as is or with ketchup (tomato sauce), salsa, and/or butter on
              toast.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h2>Notes</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              For a low-sodium version, omit salt and use unsalted butter.
            </li>
            <li>
              Grated cheddar cheese can be added into the mixture or on top of
              the cooked eggs.
            </li>
            <li>
              Sour cream may be used in place of milk for a creamier and richer
              version.
            </li>
            <li>
              Cook 1/3 cup (25 g / 0.88 oz) of crumbled cooked meats (like bacon
              or sausage) or chopped vegetables (like mushrooms or bell pepper)
              for a couple of minutes before adding the egg mixture. See also
              Southwestern Scramble.
