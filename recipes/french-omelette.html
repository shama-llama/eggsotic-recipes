          <h2>Mastering the technique of this classic dish</h2>
          <p>
            A French omelette is a dish consisting of fried beaten eggs, often
            with an added filling. The center of the omelette should be just
            barely cooked, and a little runny. The outside should be cooked, but
            not browned (or only slightly browned). The center will continue to
            cook after the omelette is removed from the pan, so be sure to eat
            it right away.

          <h2>Directions</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Loosely beat the eggs. Season the mixture with some salt and
              pepper.
            </li>
            <li>
              Heat a frying pan. Add oil and a small amount of butter when the
              pan starts to get hot. Enough to coat the pan entirely, but no
              more. Remove any excess oil.
            </li>
            <li>
              Let the pan get as hot as you can, without burning the butter, and
              keep the flame high.
            </li>
            <li>
              Pour the egg mixture into the pan and quickly tilt the pan to let
              it spread around the bottom.
            </li>
            <li>
              With a spoon or spatula, pull the solidified edges towards the
              center and tilt the pan to let the egg mixture fill the gap again.
              Keep repeating this (quickly) until there's not enough liquid egg
              left to fill the gap. The top of the omelette should still be
              liquid.
            </li>
            <li>
              Turn the heat down a little lower to fold the egg. Use a spatula
              to pry the edges loose from the pan. When the omelette is
              completely loose from the pan. Fold one part over the other. You
              can fold half of the omelette over the other half, or fold one
              third of the omelette inwards and then fold the remaining flap
              over that, to create a thicker, less wide omelette.
            </li>
            <li>Slide the omelette onto the plate.</li>
          </ol>

          <h2>Notes</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The center of a good omelette should just be a little runny. When
              serving omelettes to children, pregnant women, or elderly or ill
              people, give the omelette a little more time to cook.
            </li>
            <li>
              To decrease the amount of eggs used, use fewer eggs, and add some
              milk.
            </li>
            <li>
              Omelettes are often cooked with extra ingredients, or a 'filling'.
              How ingredients should be added depends on the ingredient. Some
              ingredients, like cheese, can be added to the egg mixture. Some
              should be fried before making the omelette (possibly in the same
              pan as the omelette, before adding the eggs). To use the
              ingredients more as a filling, than as a part of the mixture, add
              them to the omelette just before folding.
