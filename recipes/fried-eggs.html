          <h2>A comprehensive Guide to Frying Eggs</h2>
          <p>
            Fried eggs, a popular breakfast dish in the United States, Canada,
            and Western Europe, take about 5 minutes to prepare. They are often
            served with toast or with other fried dishes.

          <h2>Ingredients</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>2 teaspoons butter or olive oil</li>
            <li>2&dash;3 large eggs, depending on appetite</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
            <li>Pepper to taste (optional)</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Directions</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Melt the butter in the pan over low to medium heat.</li>
            <li>
              Crack open the eggs into the pan and let fry until the yolks begin
              to harden at the edges (indicated by a lightening in the yolk
              color).
            </li>
            <li>
              Using the spatula, flip the eggs over and allow to cook 10 seconds
              for over-easy, 30 seconds for over-medium, or up to 1 minute for
              over-hard.
            </li>
            <li>Add salt and pepper to taste, and serve.</li>

          <h2>Notes</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              It is often considered a cardinal sin to allow the yolk of an egg
              to break (although some prefer fried eggs with broken yolks). If
              the cook ensures that the eggs are fresh the yolks will be more
              'pert', and less liable to break.
            </li>
            <li>
              For sunny side-up eggs, do not flip the eggs. Use a slightly lower
              heat, and cover the pan with a lid for some of the cooking period.
              An ideal sunny side-up has a runny yolk, but the white should be
              cooked.
            </li>
            <li>
              Uncooked egg white (often called jelly) is normally unwanted and
              less-preferred than a partially cooked yolk, so err on the side of
              overcooking rather than undercooking the eggs.
            </li>
            <li>
              For a richer taste, try sprinkling the egg with grated Parmesan or
              freshly-chopped basil and chives.
            </li>
            <li>
              When frying eggs for sandwiches, rolls or wraps, it is often a
              good idea to break the yolks. This increases the coverage of yolk
              so that every bite gets some yolk, and it prevents uncooked yolk
              dripping out
